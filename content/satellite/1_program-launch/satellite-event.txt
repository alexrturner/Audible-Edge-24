Description: <p>Join us on Wednesday March 13 from 6pm at Astral Weeks for a drink to celebrate the return of the festival and be the first to see the program in full. </p><p>The night features contributions from two projects which carry Audible Edge’s spirit of contrast, play and improvisation.</p><p>Audible Edge’s very own web designer and oddball experimentalist Sookie will present one of their fabled DJ sets between 6-9pm. Weaving vinyl, lo-fi field recordings and Youtube video samples together the vibe is joyfully intimate and impeccably strange.</p><p>At 7pm, Avant-jazz quartet Group Therapy, featuring Djuna Lee (bass), Jessica Carlton (trumpet), Simon Charles (saxophones) and Pete Evans (drums), will play a live set of driving and rhythmic improvised music. </p><p>There might be other silly antics, maybe a brief speech or two. Festival curators Annika Moses &amp; Josten Myburgh may share some strange items from their record collections later into the night.</p><p>Printed programs will be there in abundance and maybe some other surprises. Astral Weeks’ wine list is really good — and be sure to take a punt on the in-house curated cocktails...</p><p>Entry is free, but we encourage you to donate generously to the Audible Edge fundraiser.</p>

Accessibility: Astral Weeks is a small, acoustically treated space. It's a small bar and as such alcohol will be present. It is likely to be crowded on the night (about 55 people can fit in the room at capacity). The live music set will be played acoustically with no amplification, but may be loud and busy at times. It is wheelchair accessible at street level, and has a gender-neutral accessible bathroom. The room is indoors and airconditioned and windows are kept closed, meaning ventilation is limited. Lighting will be low and warm. No dedicated check-out space is available.
