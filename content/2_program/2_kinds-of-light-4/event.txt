Description: The final Kinds of Light of the year leans into unusual combinations and stark contrasts. The beguiling Seacrest Gardens inhabit a wonderfully strange world influenced by medieval music, early computer music, minimalism, neo-soul and free improvisation. Fragmented spoken word and lyrical melodies live inside textures made by guitars, keyboards and electronic sounds. Eduardo Cossio &amp; Michael Terrenâ€™s improvised duo combines the ringing and rattling of strings on microtonal harps with lush and meticulous musique concrete and live synthesis.
