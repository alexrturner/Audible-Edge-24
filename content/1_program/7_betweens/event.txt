Description: <p>Weâ€™ve organised some chill hangs at bars that we like to recharge before and between shows. Oddball selections from beloved local DJs, total permission, and time to relax and have a drink with festival artists, team and your friends before things get moving again.</p><p>This chill hang precedes <a href="https://ae.tonelist.com.au/program/three-flutters" title="Three flutters">Three flutters</a> at LnA. You can walk 650m from the bar to the Beaufort St Museum bus stop (Stop ID: 12132) to catch the 950 bus directly down Beaufort St, where it stops just outside LnA. There will be a group of us travelling between gigs, so please contact the AE team if you need someone to walk with.</p>

Accessibility: Astral Weeks is a small, acoustically treated space. It's a small bar and as such alcohol will be present. The music will be at a comfortable listening volume. It is wheelchair accessible at street level, and has a gender-neutral accessible bathroom. The room is indoors and airconditioned and windows are kept closed, meaning ventilation is limited. Lighting will be low and warm. No dedicated check-out space is available.
