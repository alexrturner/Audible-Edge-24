Bio-long: <p>Mystery &amp; Wonder is an independent label started in Montreal in 2017 by E Millar and Craig Pedersen. In 2023 we relocated to Boorloo. We currently have 12 releases on full-length and 7-inch vinyl, CD, download with postcard set and digital. Many of our releases focus on sound art, improvisation and compositional works that give attention to the musical possibilities inherent in combining or superimposing closely amplified elements with acoustic elements. We are interested in work that takes care with sound and timbre, structure and form, is close, direct and in high-definition. But most of all, we are interested in work that defies our understanding of all this and moves us in ways we don’t expect, work that stands on its own. We are lovers of the album as physical object. We custom cut the majority of our sleeves with high-quality paper using an industrial die-cut machine. Our latest releases include some combination of obi strips, hand-printed covers, scores, photographs, and liner notes. With the exception of a few, releases are hand-assembled.</p>
