Bio-long: <p>A settler on unceded Wadawurrung Country, Lilyâ€™s music comprises an exploratory approach to violin and vocal techniques, focusing on how they can move together to embody one indeterminate, almost inscrutable sound source. This practice - combined with fixed track collaging - forms fabled ecosystems influenced by the patterns and textures of acoustic ecology; inviting contributions from chanced upon objects, bioacoustic GPS and found sounds.</p>
