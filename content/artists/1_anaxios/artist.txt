Bio-long: <p>Anaxios is a trio, sometimes quartet, from Boorloo. We play improvised long-form melodic ambience and drone using violin, guitar, organ, sampler and electronics. We've been playing for around 7 years. Our music is peaceful, oppressive, dream-like, harsh, and light. The individual members are involved in some other interesting projects - Cohen Bourgault (violin) is a composer and psych-folk artist, Tim Loughman (electronics/sampler) has a long running electronic music project, Basic Mind, and is a fabulous DJ, Louis Hooper (organ) played in the art-rock group Wind Waker and David West (guitar/organ/electronics) has been in underground bands like Rat Columns, Lace Curtain, Burning Sensation, Scythe, to name a few.</p>
