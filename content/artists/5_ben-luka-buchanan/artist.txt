Bio-long: <p>Luka &amp; Ben Buchanan are a sibling duo exploring poetic relationships in music, using cello &amp; spoken word to convey complex emotional landscapes. Their sound is informed by a passion for improvisation and DIY methods. Luka Buchanan (they/them) is a visual artist and poet from Boorloo. Lukaâ€™s practice involves painting, drawing, collage, performance, and spoken word. Their approach is speculative, often emotional, and investigates love, trauma, &amp; (un)gendered bodyhood. Ben Buchanan (he/him) is a cellist and emerging musician studying composition at WAAPA.</p>
