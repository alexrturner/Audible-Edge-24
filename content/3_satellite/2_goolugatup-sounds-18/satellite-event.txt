Description: <p>We're pleased to be partnering on co-presenting one of our favourite series' in town, Goolugatup Sounds. The show is one week prior to Audible Edge on April 20, and rolls out slowly from 4pm into the early evening. Thanks to Goolugatup Heathcote for working with us on this one.</p><p>Witness the iconic free-improv drumming of Shoji Hano, on tour from Japan. A titan of the Japanese free-jazz-and-beyond scene, Hano’s solo drum kit performances are intense, playful and flowingly rhythmic. A rare chance to hear the embodied wisdom of a performer who has spent their whole life improvising.</p><p>Alongside him are Boorloo sax heroes Josten Myburgh and Erin Royer, performing two pieces for saxophone duo: Philip Glass’ “Music in Fifths” and Josten Myburgh’s new “alpine translocations”. Two works with contrasting approaches to minimalism and repetition, both featuring a staggering amount of circular breathing.</p><p>Plus, DJ Curlisu! Entry is free, with food, full bar and captivating art exhibitions alongside. Head to Goolugatup Heathcote, Applecross from 4pm on Saturday April 20.</p>
