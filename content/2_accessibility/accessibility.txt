Title: Accessibility

----

Intro: Tone List aspires to make our events safer for the needs and cultures of disabled people. To this end, we are working with peer artist and consultant Patrick Gunasekera to explore ways that we can improve the accessibility of Audible Edge now and into the future. Below are some of the ways we are supporting access at the festival this year.

Description:

Accessibility details will always be listed on events, including information regarding: wheelchair accessibility, volume levels, spaciousness/crowdedness of venue, lighting, whether alcohol is present or not, and the presence of specific accessibility provisions at an event (such as a low-sensory space).

All Audible Edge events will be in wheelchair accessible venues. All audience members enter the venue via the same entranceway. No strobes or fast flashing lights will be used throughout the festival. Support workers, companion card holders and other caregivers may always enter events for free.

Tone List have a small budget to facilitate accessibility requirements for our audience members. Requirements we can assist with facilitating are:

- AUSLAN interpretation of events through Stage Left AUSLAN
- Audio description through DADAA
- Accessible taxi bookings for safe transport to and from events

Other services or providers may be requested and we will do our best to accommodate.
