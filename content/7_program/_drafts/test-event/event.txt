Description: <p>Kinds of Light is a concert series for creative music in the striking surrounds of PS Art Space in Walyalup/Fremantle. Curated by composer and improvising musician Josten Myburgh, Kinds of Light celebrates ambitious experimentation, careful musicianship, and sounds that are relevant to this place and time. It is programmed across style and genre, excited by the love and rigour that goes into music that defies categories.</p><p>Kinds of Light kicks off in 2024 with a co-curation with Boorloo-via-Montreal label Mystery &amp; Wonder. E Millar will present a live instantiation of her artificial field recording project. Craig Pedersen, joined by Michael Terren, Djuna Lee, Josten Myburgh &amp; Sage Pbbbt, will perform his composition “residues”.</p><p>E Millar is a builder of intricate kinetic sound sculptures using recycled consumer-grade electronics and found objects. Her instruments together accumulate to form what sounds uncannily like a tiny forest: bristling and subtly shifting.</p><p>Craig Pedersen is a composer and trumpet player. His collective compositional output, largely in the form of text-based scores on index cards, embodies the dream of an ever-shifting body of work, flexible to the expressive needs of the present. At Kinds of Light he’ll present a suite of compositions titled “residues”, exploring themes of place, time, body and collective biographies, performing on electric bass alongside friends from the local scene, Chris Cobilis (electronics, guitar), Michael Terren (electronics), Djuna Lee (double bass), Josten Myburgh (saxophone, percussion) and Sage Pbbbt (voice, percussion).</p>
