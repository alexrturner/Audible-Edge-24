Description: <p>Join us on Wednesday March 13 from 6pm at Astral Weeks for a drink to celebrate the return of the festival and be the first to see the program in full. </p><p>The night features contributions from two projects which carry Audible Edge’s spirit of contrast, play and improvisation.</p><p>Audible Edge’s very own web designer and oddball experimentalist Sookie will present one of their fabled DJ sets between 6-9pm. Weaving vinyl, lo-fi field recordings and Youtube video samples together the vibe is joyfully intimate and impeccably strange.</p><p>At 7pm, Avant-jazz quartet Group Therapy, featuring Djuna Lee (bass), Jessica Carlton (trumpet), Simon Charles (saxophones) and Pete Evans (drums), will play a live set of driving and rhythmic improvised music. </p><p>There might be other silly antics, maybe a brief speech or two. Festival curators Annika Moses &amp; Josten Myburgh may share some strange items from their record collections later into the night.</p><p>Printed programs will be there in abundance and maybe some other surprises. Astral Weeks’ wine list is really good — and be sure to take a punt on the in-house curated cocktails...</p><p>Entry is free, but we encourage you to donate generously to the Audible Edge fundraiser.</p>
