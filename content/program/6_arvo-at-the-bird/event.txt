Description: <p>All the clouds go to school<em> </em>is a curve-ball afternoon gig that celebrates local legends in the north-side home of indie music, The Bird. Grab a cold one and ease into this playful, curious and wandering array of live sets from the best of Boorloo’s underground DIY scene. </p><p>Experimental post-rock geniuses The Definitives combine unassuming yet profound lyricism with charming ocker delivery and way-out instrumental grooves. They perform as a large collective with spoken word, guitars, drum machines and synthesizers. The music they make together is free-form and raucous, yet also tender and personal.</p><p>Multi-disciplinary artist Luka Buchanan collaborates with emerging composer (and sibling!) Ben Buchanan, in a compelling duo of cello and spoken word. Together they explore poetic relationships in music, conveying complex emotional landscapes in nuanced detail. Their sound is informed by a passion for improvisation, lo-fi aesthetics and DIY methods.</p><p>Local improvising trio Anaxios create melodic ambience in a time-stretched dream state. Featuring Cohen Bourgault, the prolific David West (Rat Columns, Lace Curtain, Burning Sensation, Scythe), and Tim Loughman (Basic Mind), Anaxios unite their individual sensibilities towards acoustic DIY and ambient electronic practices.  </p><p>We recommend you check out Patrick Gunasekera’s durational performance <a href="https://ae.tonelist.com.au/program/after-lili" title="After Lili">After Lili</a> in the State Library of Western Australia’s Theatrette before hand - or even in the gaps between sets. After The Bird, you can keep the party rolling with evening drinks and social hangs at <a href="https://ae.tonelist.com.au/program/astral-weeks-interstitial-hang" title="Betweens">Betweens</a>, featuring selections from Cooper Cooper at Astral Weeks, before kicking on to <a href="https://ae.tonelist.com.au/program/three-flutters" title="Three flutters">Three flutters</a> in the evening.</p>

Accessibility: The Bird is a wheelchair accessible venue at street level from the pavement, the stage area and courtyard are ramp accessible. It has one gender-neutral, wheelchair accessible bathroom in the courtyard. The music will have moments where it is loud, repetitive, percussive or highly stimulating. Alcohol will be served at the venue. The venue is large, and the front and rear door will be kept open for the duration of the performance. Music is broadcast to the courtyard and can be listened to from there if preferred. The centre of the area, and the bar, may be very crowded at times. Projections and lights will be used which may be bright at times (no flashing lights or strobes will be used; performers using projections have been briefed on access considerations for photosensitive epilepsy).
