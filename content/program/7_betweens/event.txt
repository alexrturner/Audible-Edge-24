Description: <p>Weâ€™ve organised some chill hangs at bars that we like to recharge before and between shows. Oddball selections from beloved local DJs, total permission, and time to relax and have a drink with festival artists, team and your friends before things get moving again.</p><p>Astral Weeks is a small, acoustically treated space. It's a small bar and as such alcohol will be present. It is likely to be crowded on the night (about 55 people can fit in the room at capacity). It is wheelchair accessible at street level, and has a gender-neutral accessible bathroom. The room is indoors and airconditioned and windows are kept closed, meaning ventilation is limited. Lighting will be low and warm. No dedicated check-out space is available.</p>
