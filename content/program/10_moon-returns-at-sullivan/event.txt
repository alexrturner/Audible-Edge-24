Title: I make big noise and make small sound, I am in the air and on the ground, I'm out of sight and can be found. What am I?

Accessibility: The Sullivan Hall is a wheelchair accessible venue, accessible via the footpath on inclined but smooth terrain. The music will mostly be at a comfortable volume but may occasionally be very quiet or a little loud. It will be well-lit with natural light. The event is alcohol-free and all ages. There will be free food available including gluten-free and vegan options, and non-alcoholic drinks for sale. There are two accessible all-gender bathrooms located outside the venue, connected via a footpath. The venue is spacious and windows and doors can be kept open throughout most of the performances for the duration. Some of the quieter performances will involve the doors and windows being closed, and then re-opened after the performance. There is no dedicated indoor check-out space, but you can go outside into the garden, or even across the road into the park. Emilie Monty's work gives the opportunity to check out and do a focussed listening activity by yourself or with a few friends whenever you feel like it.
