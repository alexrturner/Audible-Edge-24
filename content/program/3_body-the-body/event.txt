Accessibility: PS Art Space is a wheelchair accessible venue at street level from the pavement. It has one women’s bathroom and one gender-neutral, wheelchair accessible bathroom located on the ground floor. The music will have moments where it is very loud, repetitive, percussive or highly stimulating, increasingly so towards the later parts of the evening. Alcohol will be served at the venue. The venue is large, and the front door will be kept open for the duration of the performance, but there are no windows for ventilation in the main gallery. The centre of the area, and the bar, may be very crowded at times. A fog machine will be used for some of the performances. Projections and lights will be used which may be bright at times (no flashing lights or strobes will be used; performers using projections have been briefed on access considerations for photosensitive epilepsy). Two “rave aunties” will be present in the space to provide water and other assistance if required. There is no dedicated check-out space booked for the space currently.
