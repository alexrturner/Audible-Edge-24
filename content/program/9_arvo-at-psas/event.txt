Accessibility: PS Art Space is a wheelchair accessible venue at street level from the pavement. It has one womenâ€™s bathroom and one gender-neutral, wheelchair accessible bathroom located on the ground floor. The music will be acoustic, it will at times be very soft. The venue is large with adequate space for social distancing. The front door will be kept open prior to the performance, but largely closed during the show. There are no windows for ventilation in the main gallery. Lighting will be simple warm washes, the space may be a little dark at times. There is no dedicated check-out space booked for the space currently.
