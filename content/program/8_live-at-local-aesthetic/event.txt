Accessibility: Local & Aesthetic is a wheelchair accessible venue. Entry will be via the ramp on the right hand side of the building, rather than the front doors. It has one gender-neutral, wheelchair accessible bathroom towards the rear of the venue. The music will have moments where it is loud, repetitive, percussive or overwhelming. Alcohol and food will be served at the venue. The venue is large. Doors and windows to the venue will be open during the breaks, but closed during the music performances. The space may feel crowded at times. Lighting will not involve fast flashing lights or strobes, and will shift and change in colour and tone throughout the performance. There is no dedicated check-out space booked for the space.
