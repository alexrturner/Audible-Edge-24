Accessibility: The Kings Complex building is wheelchair accessible via the ramp entry. Cool Change is located on the second level, accessible via lift. Doorways are 83cm wide. There are no accessible bathrooms in the building. The closest accessible bathroom is located in the City of Perth Library, 150m down the road on Hay Street. No alcohol will be served at the venue. The Cool Change Project Space is small, and does not have windows that can be kept open. The space may feel crowded at times. Projections and lights will be used which may be bright at times (no flashing lights or strobes will be used; performers using projections have been briefed on access considerations for photosensitive epilepsy). Two “rave aunties” will be present in the space to provide water and other assistance if required. There is no dedicated check-out space booked for the space currently.
